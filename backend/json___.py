To skip our detailed analysis of the tech industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In.\n\nFrom FAANG to the Magnificent 7 and Beyond\n\nThe technology sector has been on a steady rise for quite a while now, and the most obvious answer to the industry\'s propulsion to greater and greater heights is the ongoing obsession with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Many within the AI space today are large tech companies, such as the FAANG names. These days, however, a new moniker has been on the rise to identify the best tech companies of the day: the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe original cohort of tech names to keep an eye on included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), all coming together to form the FAANG group. Today, these companies are challenged by several others in the market, particularly semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA isn\'t alone either, and so the original list of FAANG stocks has had to accommodate the rise of new and old mega-tech companies bolstered by the emergence of AI.\n\nRegardless of what you call these companies or who joins these new exciting groups, the fact remains that the tech sector has been abuzz with news of innovations, rising investments, and higher profitability. At the end of the day, it\'s starting to look like tech companies really are starting to rule the world.\n\nThe Three AI Amigos\n\nOn February 8, Gene Munster, the managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, joined CNBC\'s "Squawk Box" to discuss recent trends in the tech sector and the rise of FAANG stocks, particularly Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here\'s what he had to say:\n\n"They have the biggest upside potential relative to where expectations are... these three, I think, are largely unappreciated. I just wanna start with Meta. I think it\'s the biggest AI opportunity that\'s misunderstood. Most investors understand that Meta is using AI to improve ad campaigns, ad attribution... but there is a significant underappreciated lever that could take this into a whole different atmosphere. This theory comes from Deepwater\'s Doug Clinton. He believes that ultimately, they will monetize Llama. Llama is an opensource model. The other foundation models, Claude, and ChatGPT, and Gemini, they\'re all closed. Llama has 30 million downloads. If they monetize this, they will likely announce a cloud infrastructure... that is a whole new shift, and new benefit to Meta."\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the rise of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, Munster said the following:\n\n"Apple\'s gonna come out with their own foundation model likely in June, and they\'re gonna allow this to do personalized AI. This is really gonna capture 20% of the world\'s interest, and they can charge $10 a month for this."\n\nMost investors have been overlooking Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, but Munster thinks the company is on its way to benefitting from a new opportunity.\n\nBiden Administration\'s Investment in Chips\n\nIn an additional boost for the tech sector, the Biden Administration has announced a $5 billion investment in chips, a move that is bound to uplift the semiconductor industry. On February 9, Ronnie Chatterji, professor at Duke University and former White House Chips Coordinator, joined CNBC\'s "Squawk Box" to discuss this move. He noted that this move signals a partnership between the public and private sectors to ensure that the US continues to lead "in the current generation of chips" alongside the "next generation." The investment is thus being welcomed overwhelmingly and may signal greater things for semiconductor companies in 2024.\n\nWith the current situation being so overwhelmingly in favor of tech companies, we have compiled a list of the best FAANG stocks to buy now. These include some of the top American tech stocks to buy apart from the original FAANG stocks. 11 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In\n\nA technician at a workstation, preparing and calibrating a sensor for automotive microcontrollers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe compiled our list of the best FAANG stocks to invest in by consulting Insider Monkey\'s hedge fund data for the third quarter and selecting major tech companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nBest FAANG Stocks To Invest In\n\n11. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 102\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is among the original FAANG names. It is a streaming company that operates a popular online streaming platform by the name of Netflix. The company is based in Los Gatos, California.\n\nDZ Bank analyst Markus Leistner upgraded shares of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) from Hold to Buy and placed a $600 price target on the stock on January 25.\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was found in the 13F holdings of 102 hedge funds at the end of the third quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $7.8 billion.\n\nPolen Capital mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were\xa0Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.\n\nDuring Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.\n\nFast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is among the best FAANG stocks to buy now.\n\n10. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 107\n\nAn Overweight rating was maintained on shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) by Simon Coles at Barclays on January 19. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $110 to $125.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is an information technology company. The company manufactures and sells integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices. It is based in Taiwan.\n\nWe saw 107 hedge funds long Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in the third quarter, with a total stake value of $9.7 billion.\n\nFisher Asset Management was the most prominent shareholder in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) at the end of the third quarter, holding 31.1 million shares in the company.\n\nHere\'s what Wedgewood Partners said about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n9. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nThere were 110 hedge funds long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in the third quarter, with a total stake value of $9.2 billion.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is another semiconductor company on our list of the best FAANG stocks to buy. The company is based in Santa Clara, California, and offers graphics processing units, chipsets, and embedded processors, among more.\n\nToshiya Hari, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, maintains a Buy rating on shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as of February 1. The analyst also raised the firm\'s price target on the stock from $157 to $180.\n\n8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), holding 4.6 million shares in the company.\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a computer software company based in San Jose, California, and is one of the most attractive stocks on our list of the best FAANG stocks to buy. It offers products such as the Document Cloud, a unified cloud-based document services platform, and the Creative Cloud, a subscription service providing access to creative products.\n\nAs of January 2, Piper Sandler\'s Brent Bracelin holds an Overweight rating on shares of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $650 to $705.\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was seen in the portfolios of 112 hedge funds in the third quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $8.2 billion.\n\n7. salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 122\n\nBased in San Francisco, California, salesforce.com, inc.

(NYSE:CRM) had 122 hedge funds long its stock, with a total stake value of $10.5 billion.\n\nAn Outperform rating was maintained on salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) on January 23 by Rob Oliver at Baird. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $300 to $310.\n\nPolen Capital said the following about salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and\xa0Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top FAANG+ stocks to invest in today.\n\n6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 134\n\nHolding 54.9 million shares in the company, Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder in Apple Inc.\xa0 (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the end of the third quarter.\n\nSamik Chatterjee at JP Morgan maintains an Overweight rating on Apple Inc.\xa0 (NASDAQ:AAPL) alongside a $215 price target as of February 2.\n\nApple Inc.\xa0 (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a big tech company and one of the best FAANG stocks on our list. It is based in Cupertino, California, and is well known for its flagship iPhone, iPad, and Mac products.\n\nOur hedge fund data for the third quarter shows 134 hedge funds holding stakes in Apple Inc.\xa0 (NASDAQ:AAPL). Their total stake value in the company was $179 billion.\n\nBireme Capital mentioned Apple Inc.\xa0 (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also shorted\xa0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks 10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years\n\nDisclosure: None. 11 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In is originally published by Insider Monkey.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-faang-stocks-invest-215344511.html', 'symbols': ['0R2V.IL', '0RIH.IL', '2330.TW', 'A1MD34.SA', 'AAPL.BA', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.NEO', 'AAPL.SN', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABE0.F', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.STU', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'ADB.DU', 'ADB.F', 'ADB.HM'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.158}}, {'date': '2024-02-09T20:04:08+00:00', 'title': "S&amp;P 500 hits 5,000 for first time; Microsoft topples Apple as world's largest company", 'content': 'The S&P 500 has never been higher, closing above the 5,000 level for the first time ever as improving corporate earnings and better-than-expected economic data fuel investor optimism.\n\nThat optimism got an extra push Friday after revised data showed consumer inflation moderated at the end of last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHowever, strategists caution the upward move is heavily tied to just a handful of companies.\n\n"Technology is really important, as you know.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $188.08 at the end of trading on February 8. In the preceding 52 weeks, the stock price has fluctuated from $143.90 to $199.62.\n\nOn February 1, Apple reported its first quarter earnings results for the quarter ending December 30, 2023. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showed payments for dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.825 billion, up from $3.768 billion in the same period in 2022.\n\nBased on its current quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share, the annualized dividend for Apple is $0.96 per share. Using the stock price at the close on February 8, its dividend yield is about 0.51%.\n\nHow Can You Earn $500 Per Month As An Apple Investor?\n\nIf you have an earnings target of $500 per month or $6,000 annually from Apple\'s dividends, your investment value needs to be $1,176,471 which is 6,255 shares at $188.08 each. But if you reduce your earnings target to $100 per month, your investment value drops to $235,294 or 1,251 shares.\n\nDon\'t Miss:\n\nCollecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Dara Khosrowshahi gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started. How to earn $500 Per Month In Passive Income Through Real Estate Without Becoming A Landlord\n\nHow to calculate your estimated value of investments using dividend yields: To calculate an estimated investment value, you need two critical variables — the desired annual earnings target ($6,000 or $1,200) and the dividend yield of the stock (0.51% in this case). So, $6,000 / 0.0051 = $1,176,471 to generate an income of $500 per month, and $1,200 / 0.0051 = $235,294 for $100 per month.\n\nTo calculate the dividend yield, you need to divide the annual dividend payments by the stock’s current price. It is important to note that a company\'s dividend yield may change over time. This is because of the fluctuations in stock prices and changes in dividend policies on a rolling basis. Assuming that the stock price does not fluctuate or the capital appreciation is not factored into the calculations, the dividend value and its yield are positively correlated.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2 / $50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2 / $60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2 / $40).\n\nDisclaimer: This calculation is according to the price per share on Feb. 8 using an annualized dividend. The price of Apple stock at the end of trading on Feb. 8 was $188.08.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class.

It didn’t work', 'content': 'Angela Ahrendts may have played one of the toughest games of hard-to-get ever with Apple CEO Tim Cook. In 2014 when Ahrendts was CEO of London-based luxury retail brand Burberry, Cook tried to persuade her several times to head up retail at the Cupertino, Calif.–based tech giant.\n\nAhrendts was steadfast in convincing Cook that she wasn’t the right fit for the job.\n\n“I’m absolutely not a techie,” she told Cook, according to a 2016 interview at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit. “I’m actually not even a great retailer.” But Cook didn’t take the bait, telling her that the company had plenty of tech-focused employees and had “the most productive stores in the world.”\n\nWhat Apple didn’t have, though, was Ahrendts’s attention to community and ability to humanize a company that had become one of the world’s most profitable. It was a 2011 TED Talk that Ahrendts had given that really caught Cook’s attention—one that was focused on the idea of human energy. Her thesis was that the more technologically advanced our society becomes, the more we need to go back to the basic fundamentals of human communication.\n\n“Trust just takes all the barriers away,” Ahrendts said. “I think it’s the same in a personal relationship or in a small business or a huge business.”\n\nThis wisdom that Ahrendts has preached since 2011 is what got her noticed by leaders and celebrities alike. It’s what got her from a small town in Indiana to heading up Apple retail as a senior vice president—and now serving as a senior operating adviser at Kim Kardashian’s new private equity fund, SKKY Partners. It’s those soft skills—like earnest communication and building trust—that can make non-techies attractive to the biggest players in the industry and encourage leaders to look beyond just a résumé.\n\nFor Ahrendts, it wasn’t the clout of the position or even the brand name of the company that made her eventually give in to Cook. It was the promise of being able to build something new and community-focused for a brand that she saw as having a major impact on the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom small-town living to Apple exec\n\nAhrendts comes from humble beginnings. She was born and raised in New Palestine, Ind., with a population of just over 2,000, and was one of six children in her family. She played tennis, swam, and did gymnastics—and had her first job as a server. She studied at Ball State University before stints at Donna Karan International (DKNY), Liz Claiborne, and Burberry.\n\nWhen Ahrendts became CEO of Burberry in 2006, she was featured on Fortune’s magazine cover holding an iPad—a symbol showing the company’s commitment to equipping sales representatives with the technology they needed when working with consumers. Little did she know, though, that she’d eventually become one of the top executives at the company that created the very device that made Burberry so successful.\n\n“We turned the company around because of Apple—because of all that their technology enabled us to do all over the world,” Ahrendts said. At the time, Ahrendts said that she had “the greatest job in the world,” even to Cook when he first started trying to recruit her to join Apple. She also couldn’t imagine leaving London, where she and her family had been living for almost a decade. But that started to change during a visit back to the States for the holidays.\n\nApple caught wind that Ahrendts would be home for the holidays and offered to fly her out and meet with her again.\n\n“I again admired everything he was doing at Apple, so I did [go], but my mission was to talk him out of me,” Ahrendts said. At the time, Ahrendts still turned Cook down, but an email exchange later on is what locked her into a future with the company.\n\nAfter receiving an email from Cook following her visit, Ahrendts sent a “gracious” and “humble” email letting him down—but with one caveat. If Apple would ever consider integrating its retail stores with its online business model, then she’d consider it.\n\n“At Burberry, we did everything digital first,” she said. “I wanted to make sure that they did something even greater [where the company] played a more important role in the community.” That alone sparked Cook’s interest, and led to Apple’s great retail redesign after she finally took the job in 2014.\n\nSuccess at Apple\n\nWith a focus on community, Apple introduced more programming at its stores for adults and children alike, educating them in things like photography and tech features they wouldn’t otherwise be able to learn. She heralded change at Apple retail stores, which she refers to as “town squares” where the consumer experience is less about selling them a product and more about helping the customer discover all of the potential that they—and their devices—have. She was also behind the brand’s illustrious gold watch launch and can be thanked for shorter lines at the Apple store owing to her focus on online retail.\n\nAfter a successful run with Apple, Ahrendts stepped down in 2019 and served on the boards of Airbnb, Ralph Lauren, and WPP. But in October 2023, she took on her new role as a senior operating adviser at Kardashian’s private equity firm SKKY Partners, which was formed with PE industry veteran Jay Sammons. As of October, SKKY (which started in early 2023) had yet to close a deal, but “Ahrendts’s expertise may help the firm make that all-important choice of its first deal,” Emma Hinchliffe, author of Fortune’s The Broadsheet newsletter, wrote.\n\nIn terms of advice for young women pursuing a path to leadership, her biggest advice is to be confident in what you know—and what you don’t know.\n\n“It’s so easy along the way to become incredibly insecure about everything you don’t know,” she said in the 2016 interview. “Be your best self.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-exec-kim-kardashian-private-163808405.html', 'symbols': ['0R2V.IL', 'AAPL.BA', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.NEO', 'AAPL.SN', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.BE', 'APC.DU', 'APC.F', 'APC.HA', 'APC.HM', 'APC.MU', 'APC.STU', 'APC.XETRA', 'APC8.F'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.998, 'neg': 0.009, 'neu': 0.892, 'pos': 0.099}}, {'date': '2024-02-09T15:36:29+00:00', 'title': "History shows stocks will still go up even if the 'Magnificent 7' lose steam", 'content': 'The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is creeping near 5,000 for the first time ever.

Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) are having a choppier start to the year. For some on Wall Street, this has become a concern as a shrinking number of stocks are leading the major average higher.\n\nFortunately for investors, even if top stocks are peaking, the marketshould probably still go up.\n\nA recent analysis from BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski showed that even when the top stocks driving an outsized part of the market action fall off, returns over the next year for the index historicallyhave been quite good.\n\nA chart from Belski shows that since 1992,on average, the S&P 500 has risen 14.3% in the year following a peak in contribution from the top 10 stocks in the benchmark average. The only time the S&P 500 delivered a negative return in the next year was in 2001 amid the fallout from the tech bubble.\n\n"While some investors may be concerned that the market is likely to struggle without these stocks leading the way, our analysis shows that the S&P 500 has performed just fine following peaks in relative performance of the 10 largest stocks," Belski wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nGoldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider pointed out that while the degree to which topstocks are dragging the major index higher is currently abnormally high, the idea that a few winners lead the S&P 500 gains isn\'t a new concept. In fact, Snider argued, in the long run it\'s been a typical feature, not a bug, of the benchmark index.\n\nStory continues\n\n"That\'s part of why the S&P 500 or the US equity market broadly has been so strong over the years. ... New companies grow, and they become larger weights in the index, and they drag the market higher with them," the analyst told Yahoo Finance. "And eventually, there will be disruptors and new technologies that emerge and new businesses that emerge. And those will become larger. And then, it will be their turn to drag the market higher."\n\nFor the S&P to hit new records without significant contributions from the Magnificent Seven, there would need to be a broadening out in the market, where other lagging sectors begin to pick up steam. This has been seen recently in areas such as large-cap Healthcare (XLV), which is up 17% from its October lows, and the Financial Select Sector ETF (XLF), which is up 24% from October lows.\n\nWith 70% of S&P 500 companies topping analysts\' earnings per share forecasts in the fourth quarter, above the historical average of 63%, Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon pointed to the increased breadth in earnings growth as a positive catalyst moving forward.\n\n"You\'re seeing [an] even higher percentage [of] companies posting positive earnings this quarter than last quarter," Kwon told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. "So actually, earnings breadth is improving as well, and that\'s a positive cycle for equities."\n\nSnider thinks this broadening out is the most likely scenario this year once investors feel more confident in the Federal Reserve\'s interest rate-cutting path.\n\n"As investors stop worrying so much about exactly when the Fed will start to cut rates, I think we\'ll see a lot of these companies outside of the Magnificent Seven have pretty strong earnings growth, and that will cause them to do pretty well in turn," Snider said.

Forecast demand based on volumes of their previous consumer products. Confuse consumers by defining a new category without a frame of reference. Discover that the hardware doesn’t match the needs of their existing customer base. Work hard and spend a lot of money on trying to push sales on their existing customers. Revenue woefully falls short of forecast. Marketing and capital expenses (new factory, high research and development expense) were predicated on consumer-scale sales. The new product is burning a ton of cash. Ignore or fail to understand adjacent niche industrial markets that would have rushed to buy the product if the company had developed niche-specific demos and outreach. Eventually, pivot to the niche markets that are excited about the product. The niche markets make for great beachhead markets but are too small to match the inflated forecasts and the built-in burn rates of consumer-scale sales. After multiple market pivots and changes in leadership, abandon the product.\n\nA Kodak déjà vu\n\nI lived through the equivalent of this when Kodak (remember them?) launched a product in 1990 called PhotoCD. Kodak wanted consumers to put their film photos on their home CDROM drives and then display them on their televisions. You dropped off your film at a film processor and instead of just getting physical prints of your pictures they would scan the film and burn them onto a Compact Disc. You’d go home with a Compact Disc with your pictures on it.\n\nI got a preview of PhotoCD when I was the head of marketing at SuperMac, a supplier of hardware and software for graphics professionals. The moment I saw the product I knew every one of my professional graphics customers (ad agencies, freelancers, photo studios, etc.) would want to use it. In fact, they would have paid a premium for it. I was floored when Kodak told me they were launching PhotoCD as a consumer product.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe problem was that in 1990, consumers did not have CDROM drives to display the pictures. At the time, even most personal computers lacked them. Meanwhile, every graphics professional did own a CDROM drive but most didn’t own a high-resolution film scanner. They would have been the perfect launch customers for PhotoCD. To this day, I remember being lectured by a senior Kodak executive, “Steve you don’t get it, we’re experts at selling to consumers. We’ll sell them the CDROM drives as well.”\n\nExcept the Kodak CDROM drives were the size of professional audio equipment and depending on the model, cost $600 to $1000 in today’s dollars. And when consumer CDROM drives became available they couldn’t play the PhotoCD disks as they were encoded in a proprietary Kodak standard to lock you into their drives!\n\nThe result? PhotoCD failed miserably as a consumer product. Subsequent pivots to professional graphics users (a segment they knew well) came too late, as low-cost scanners and non-proprietary standards (JPEG) prevailed.\n\nGetting it right\n\nSimilarly, Apple is trying to push Vision Pro onto their existing consumer customers. All the demos and existing applications are tailored to the consumer market.\n\nAdditionally, Apple did not create demos for how the Vision Pro could be used in new markets where users would jump at the opportunity to buy a Vision Pro. For example, the internet is rife with proof of demand in an adjacent mass market: helping millions of homeowners repair things around their property.\n\nThere is also proven demand for Industrial applications outside of the consumer space. Every company that has complex machinery has been experimenting with AR for years. Imagine car repair with a Vision Pro AR tutorial. Or jet engine maintenance. Or the entire gamut of complex machinery. All of these would have been great Vision Pro demos for training and repair. It’s hard to understand why Apple ignored these easy wins.\n\nApple’s entry into new markets by creating new product categories–iPods, iPads, iPhones–is unprecedented in the history of modern corporations. $300 billion (75% of their revenue) is from non-computer hardware. In addition, they’ve created an entirely new $85+ billion subscription business model with the App Store, iTunes, Apple Care, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, and Apple TV.\n\nIt’s hard to remember, but the first versions of these products launched with serious limitations that follow-on versions remedied. The first version of the iPhone only ran Apple software, it had no app store. It was a closed system. It had no copy-and-paste function, and couldn’t record video, among other limitations. The original Apple Watch was positioned as a fashion accessory. It wasn’t until later that Apple realized the Watch\'s killer apps were fitness and health. Fixing the technical flaws while finding the right markets took time and commitment.\n\nThe same will likely be true for the Vision Pro. Apple’s model is to provide the hardware and then let their developer community come up with the kind of applications. However, all of the applications on this first release are in their current markets (entertainment, music, etc.). None of these are killer apps for the product.\n\nApple marketers will realize that adjacent spaces they are less familiar with will provide the first "got to have it" beachhead markets. Newer iterations will ride the technology wave of lighter and cheaper versions.\n\nApple’s CEO Tim Cook has made a personal bet on the Vision Pro. More than any other company, they have sufficient resources (cash on hand and engineering talent) to pivot–and ensure the Vision Pro’s product-market fit in the real markets that need it. Here’s to hoping they find it.\n\nSteve Blank is an adjunct professor at Stanford and co-founder of the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation.\n\nMore must-read\xa0commentary\xa0published by\xa0Fortune:\n\nThe markets are starting to realize\xa0just how hawkish the Fed is–and reckoning with higher-for-longer interest rates Working fathers are the new target of microaggressions–and they are worried they could be getting\xa0‘daddy tracked’ WEF president: ‘It’s time to revitalize trade—and reverse the trend of Slowbalization’ The anti-DEI movement has gone\xa0from fringe to mainstream.

The duo is on track to once again claim nearly half of all digital ads revenue. Even as brands spend their way out of a multiyear ad slump, it's mega enterprises who will be feasting while mostly everyone else claws for scraps.\n\nInvestors pummeled Snap this week for posting merely 5% revenue growth, the latest example of Wall Street punishing anything that doesn't look like Zuckerbergian conquest. Meta set the bar for expansion. The social media king catapulted its advertising revenue 24% higher, more than doubling the pace of rival Google's 11%. Wall Street dinged Google for that too.\n\nWhere ad dollars flow underscores the selectiveness of the recovery. Amazon last week reported its ads business swelled 27% year over year. While the company sits in third place in the digital ads market, Amazon is poised to gobble even greater share. It's in the early stages of converting an untapped Prime Video streaming service into an ad platform with a massive, built-in audience. Watch it on Amazon then buy it on Amazon.\n\nOverall, worldwide digital ad spending is projected to increase 13.2% this year, the data shows, compared to traditional media ad growth of 2.4%.\n\nThe other major players expected to amplify their ads business are following a similar playbook of platform economics, capturing the eyeballs of enormous online ecosystems: Walmart and TikTok.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs if it couldn't get any harder to run with Big Tech, the same companies that upended the ads business through search and social media are deploying their huge cash piles to invest in new AI tools. They stand to rejigger markets and the attention economy further in their favor.\n\nEven Disney (DIS), fresh off a significant earnings beat, a dividend boost, and a burst of flashy announcements, still struggles with the baggage of a legacy media business. Its linear networks segment fell 12% compared to the same period last year, the company reported Wednesday, while the unit's operating income fell 7%.\n\nFox's (FOX) ad revenue, which makes up nearly half of the company's total sales, tumbled 20% in the December quarter versus the year prior, it disclosed earlier this week.\n\nAnd while other media names are scheduled to report later this month, including Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Paramount (PARA), it's likely their ad-reliant finances, without Bob Iger's streaming head start and dealmaking pizzazz, will reveal more of the same. morning brief image\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

I\'m talking about Berkshire Hathaway\'s (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett. Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, he has overseen a greater than 4,760,000% gain in his company\'s Class A shares (BRK.A). A seven-digit return is certainly going to get a money manager noticed -- and for good reason.\n\nWhat makes Warren Buffett such a hero for everyday investors is his willingness to share his insights on the U.S. economy and investing. Lengthy books have been written that discuss some of his favorite investing philosophies, such as buying stakes in brand-name businesses with sustainable moats and holding these positions for lengthy periods. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nHowever, the factor that isn\'t given nearly enough credit for Berkshire Hathaway\'s long-term success is portfolio concentration. Warren Buffett and his top investing aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, strongly believe in putting the lion\'s share of Berkshire\'s capital to work in their top ideas. And if these top ideas generate sizable returns, Berkshire Hathaway\'s stock is likely headed even higher.\n\nDespite Berkshire having stakes in 49 stocks, as of Sept. 30, 2023, 64% of the invested assets ($236.1 billion) Warren Buffett oversees in Berkshire Hathaway\'s $371 billion portfolio are being put to work in just three brand-name companies.\n\nApple: $170.2 billion (45.9% of invested assets)\n\nAny question of whether or not the Oracle of Omaha and his team favor portfolio concentration is made crystal clear by tech stockApple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which accounts for nearly 46% of Berkshire\'s invested assets. This Apple stake amounts to 20% of Berkshire Hathaway\'s market cap, which means the health of Apple and its stock very much matters to Berkshire Hathaway\'s investors.\n\nThe three factors that are likely most responsible for luring Warren Buffett, Todd Combs, and Ted Weschler into such an outsized position in Apple are its brand, its ongoing innovation, and its market-leading capital-return program.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn most annual brand rankings, Apple comes out on top. It has an exceptionally loyal customer base that allows the company to generate highly predictable operating cash flow. Predictability is rare in the tech sector, which is one of the reasons Apple has so consistently outperformed.\n\nBerkshire\'s investment team is likely also enamored with Apple\'s innovation. It\'s been the undisputed leader in U.S. smartphone market share for years and was on the cutting edge of innovation when it introduced the iPad in 2010.\n\nBeyond the company\'s physical product innovation, investors are witnessing CEO Tim Cook transform Apple into a services-focused business. A subscription-driven platform will not only enhance customer loyalty and Apple\'s operating margin over time, but it\'ll also help smooth out the sales fluctuations that tend to occur during major iPhone upgrade/replacement cycles.\n\nBut for Warren Buffett, Apple\'s capital-return program might be the top selling point. On top of returning around $15 billion annually to shareholders via dividends, Apple has repurchased more than $600 billion worth of its common stock since initiating a buyback program in 2013. Buffett loves buybacks because they increase Berkshire\'s ownership stake without him or his team lifting a finger.\n\nBank of America: $34.6 billion (9.3% of invested assets)\n\nAlthough it sits a long way behind Apple, money-center giant Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) is Berkshire Hathaway\'s second-largest holding at $34.6 billion in market value.\n\nOut of the 11 sectors of the stock market, there\'s none Warren Buffett is more knowledgeable about than financials. Within financials, bank stocks are the real area of focus.\n\nInterestingly enough, the reason the Oracle of Omaha and his aides have bet big on companies like BofA is because they\'re cyclical. This is to say that Bank of America is going to succeed and struggle in lockstep with the U.S. economy.\n\nEven though recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, they don\'t last very long. Instead of trying to foolishly guess when these downturns will occur, Buffett and his investing squad have angled Berkshire\'s $371 billion portfolio to take advantage of long-winded expansions. In Bank of America\'s case, it\'s able to steadily grow its loan and lease portfolio over time.\n\nWhat really separates Bank of America from countless other publicly traded banks is that it\'s the most interest-rate sensitive among U.S. money-center banks. Since March 2022, the most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in four decades has added billions of dollars in quarterly net interest income to BofA\'s bottom line.\n\nFurthermore, Bank of America is enjoying the tangible reward of investing in technology. The company\'s digitization efforts have increased the percentage of households banking online or via mobile app to 75%, as of Dec. 31, 2023. Digital transactions are considerably cheaper than in-person interactions for banks, which should be a positive for BofA\'s long-term operating efficiency.\n\nLet\'s not forget that the Oracle of Omaha also loves a good value. Bank of America stock is trading for less than 10X forward-year earnings and can be purchased for right around its book value. Image source: American Express.\n\nAmerican Express: $31.3 billion (8.4% of invested assets)\n\nThe third stock that, along with Apple and Bank of America, collectively makes up 64% of the $371 billion investment portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway is credit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP). "AmEx," as the company is more commonly known, has been a continuous holding by Berkshire since 1991.\n\nTo reiterate, Warren Buffett loves financial stocks and cyclical businesses. Even though there have been 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II, only three of these downturns managed to hit the 12-month mark, and none surpassed 18 months. Disproportionately long periods of expansion have allowed credit-services companies like American Express to thrive.\n\nThe primary reason AmEx has been such a great investment for so long is its ability to benefit from both sides of a transaction. On one hand, it\'s the No. 3 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (i.e., the largest market for consumption in the world). This means it\'s generating a healthy amount in fees from merchants by facilitating transactions.\n\nHowever, American Express is also a lender. Its cardholders are paying interest on their carried credit card balances, along with (possible) annual fees to be a cardholder. During long periods of economic growth, double-dipping can be quite fruitful for the company\'s bottom line.\n\nAnother reason AmEx outperforms is the clientele it tends to attract. American Express has always had a knack for luring high-earning cardholders.\n\nAlthough high earners aren\'t perfect, they\'re far less likely than the average consumer to alter their buying habits or fail to pay their bills during a modest economic contraction. In other words, the well-to-do are helping AmEx successfully navigate potentially challenging economic climates.\n\nI\'d be remiss if I didn\'t also mention that American Express has quietly turned into a mammoth dividend stock for Berkshire Hathaway. AmEx recently announced plans to increase its base annual payout to the equivalent of $2.80 per share. Though this represents a mere 1.36% nominal yield, based on where shares closed on Feb. 2, a $2.80 annual dividend is a 33% yield to Berkshire\'s cost basis of roughly $8.49 per AmEx share.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is on pace to generate around $6 billion in dividend income this year, with AmEx certainly doing its part.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.
